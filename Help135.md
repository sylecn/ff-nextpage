When reading online documents or novels, I usually use SPC to scroll page. But SPC doesn't go to next page automatically. This addon rebinds SPC key so that it scroll page when there is more on the page, it go to next page when at the bottom of a page. You can also use n key anytime directly to go to next page.

Currently English, Chinese and German web pages are supported.

Here is a list of keys that get rebinded:
  * SPC scroll up/next page
  * n next page
  * p history back

You can also bind these keys in add-on preferences:
  * 2 next page
  * 1 history back
  * Alt-p history back
  * Alt-n next page

A simple preference window is added to allows you to enable/disable keybindings.

This add-on is only 28K zipped.
